# ðŸ§  Black-Scholes Option Pricing Calculator

A simple web-based tool to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options using the **Black-Scholes model**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

This calculator allows users to input key parameters:
- **Stock Price (S)**
- **Strike Price (K)**
- **Time to Expiration (T)** â€“ in years
- **Volatility (Ïƒ)** â€“ as a decimal (e.g., 0.2 for 20%)
- **Risk-Free Rate (r)** â€“ as a decimal
- **Option Type** â€“ Call or Put

It returns the theoretical price based on the Black-Scholes formula.

> This project was built using **AI-assisted development** to rapidly prototype and iterate on the model, following a first-principles learning approach.

## ðŸ§® Formula

**Note:** If you have [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) or MathJax enabled in your Markdown viewer, the following formulas will render as beautiful math. If not, see the code block version below for best readability on GitHub.

The calculator uses the standard Black-Scholes formulas:

\[
C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
\]
\[
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S N(-d_1)
\]

Where:

\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\]

### Plain Text / Code Block Version (for GitHub)

```
C = S N(d1) - K e^{-rT} N(d2)
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S N(-d1)

d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + ÏƒÂ² / 2)T] / (ÏƒâˆšT)
d2 = d1 - ÏƒâˆšT
```
