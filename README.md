# ðŸ§  Black-Scholes Option Pricing Calculator

A simple web-based tool to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options using the **Black-Scholes model**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

This calculator allows users to input key parameters:
- **Stock Price (S)**
- **Strike Price (K)**
- **Time to Expiration (T)** â€“ in years
- **Volatility (Ïƒ)** â€“ as a decimal (e.g., 0.2 for 20%)
- **Risk-Free Rate (r)** â€“ as a decimal
- **Option Type** â€“ Call or Put

It returns the theoretical price based on the Black-Scholes formula.

> This project was built using **AI-assisted development** to rapidly prototype and iterate on the model, following a first-principles learning approach.

## ðŸ§® Formula

The calculator uses the standard Black-Scholes formulas:

\[
C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
\]
\[
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S N(-d_1)
\]

Where:

\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\]
